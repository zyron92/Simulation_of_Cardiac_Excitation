# Simulation_of_Cardiac_Excitation
Simple simulation of cardiac excitation using scilab (matlab) via a series of exercises

##
###Preliminaries
- The code is produced in a mix of english and french (mostly)
- The code is commented in french
- This is a team-work project with Etienne QUAY-THEVENON

##
### Descriptions
- To launch all the codes, we need scilab code executer
- First few exercises are related to discrete form of differential equation (the mathematical base for the simulation)

##
There are still bugs to be resolved, and improvements to be done.
